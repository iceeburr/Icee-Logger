(non-Windows) If the child process of a ``onefile`` frozen application
is terminated by a signal, delay re-raising of the signal in the parent
process until after the clean up has been performed. This prevents
``onefile`` frozen applications from leaving behind their unpacked
temporary directories when either the parent or the child process is
sent the ``SIGTERM`` signal.
