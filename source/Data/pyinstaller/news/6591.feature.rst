(Windows) Implement handling of console control signals in the ``onefile``
bootloader parent process. The implemented handler suppresses the
``CTRL_C_EVENT`` and ``CTRL_BREAK_EVENT`` to let the child process
deal with them as they see it fit. In the case of ``CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT``,
``CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT``, or ``CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT``, the handler attempts
to delay the termination of the parent process in order to buy time for
the child process to exit and for the main thread of the parent process
to clean up the temporary directory before exiting itself. This should
prevent the temporary directory of a ``onefile`` frozen application
being left behind when the user closes the console window.
