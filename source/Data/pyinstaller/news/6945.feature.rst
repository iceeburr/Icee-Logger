Implement a mechanism for controlling the collection mode of modules and
packages, with granularity ranging from top-level packages to individual
sub-modules. Therefore, the hooks can now specify whether the hooked
package should be collected as byte-compiled .pyc modules into embedded
PYZ archive (the default behavior), or as source .py files collected as
external data files (without corresponding modules in the PYZ archive).
